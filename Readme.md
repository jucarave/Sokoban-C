# Sokoban

This is my second project made in C, a clone of the game Sokoban for the terminal. Move your character by using WASD + enter or by entering Z to undo your last movement. The game has two levels and they are read from a game.data file.

## Installation

Use make to compile the game, or make debug to build a debug executable

```bash
make
```

```bash
make debug
```
